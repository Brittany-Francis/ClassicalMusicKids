                    <p><strong>About:</strong> Born in Los Angeles, California in 1912, John Cage was a composer with many creative ideas. While his earliest compositions were based off twelve tone music, he became increasingly experimental in his music as he got older. One way he liked to create music was by "chance". There are a few ways he did this, one of which was using the Chinese text the "I Ching" to help him make decisions on what should come next in the music. He also created chance music by using the roll of dice to set certain outcomes in what he composed. Another creative way he wrote music was his compositions for the prepared piano. He would open up a grand piano and insert objects such as screws, bolts, and erasers in between the strings, giving the piano a completely different sound. Another of his famous compositions involved using 12 radios simultaneously and having the performers tune to different stations at different times during the performance, making every performance unique. John Cage passed away from a stroke at age 79 in 1992. </p>
