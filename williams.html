                    <p><strong>About: </strong> Born in New York, John Williams learned music at an early age. His father was a jazz drummer and percussionist and insisted his children learn music. Williams even formed a band with his friends and siblings in his youth! He joined the Army Band in 1951, playing piano, arranging and conducting for them. Afterwards, he headed to Julliard to study music. He became interested in film music and ended up becoming one of the most prolific composers of film scores. His big break was the composition for the movie "Jaws", on which he worked with director Steven Spielberg. They have worked on many films together since. Some of his most famous works include the themes to "Harry Potter", "Indiana Jones", and "Jurassic Park". </p>
